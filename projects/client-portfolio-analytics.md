## Project Overview

This project delivers a **comprehensive Client Portfolio Analysis dashboard** designed to help senior stakeholders understand **AUM trends, client churn, fee performance, and adviser/team accountability**.

The solution supports:
- Executive decision-making
- Revenue protection
- Client retention strategy
- Adviser and team performance management

Built using **Power BI**, with robust **data modelling, DAX measures, and automated transformations**, the dashboard enables users to move seamlessly from **high-level trends to client-level root causes**.

## Business Problem

The organisation faced:
- A **significant decline in Assets Under Management (AUM)**
- A sharp **reduction in fee income**, despite stable pricing policies
- Limited visibility into **which clients, advisers, and teams** were driving losses
- Manual, fragmented reporting that lacked auditability and drill-down capability

Stakeholders needed a **single source of truth** to answer:
- *Why is AUM declining?*
- *Which clients are leaving and why?*
- *Where is fee leakage occurring?*
- *Who owns the problem — advisers, teams, or regions?*

---

## Solution Architecture

- **Power BI** for interactive reporting and storytelling
- **Star-schema data model** optimised for performance
- **Advanced DAX** for YoY growth, variance, CAGR, contribution analysis
- **Power Query** for data cleansing and transformation
- Role-driven navigation across **Overview**, **Fee Performance**, and **Team Performance**
